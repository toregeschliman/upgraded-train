# Steve's Web scraper

This is a simple Selenium Webdriver API endpoint for scraping business data from websites. Pass it a json dict formatted like sample.json, with xpaths for all your elements, and it will return a similar JSON dict with the text content. sample-frontend shows you how to submit requests and write the results as a csv.
